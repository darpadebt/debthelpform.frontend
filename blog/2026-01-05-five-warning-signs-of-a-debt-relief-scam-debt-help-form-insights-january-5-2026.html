<h1>** How to Get Out of Debt Without Ruining Your Credit: A Guide to Debt Consolidation Loans</h1>
  <h2>** How to Get Out of Debt Without Ruining Your Credit: A Guide to Debt Consolidation Loans</h2>
  <p>Evergreen guidance that helps borrowers recognize high-pressure pitches, upfront fees, and other scam signals before they sign anything. We didn't surface brand-new debt relief headlines today, so Debt Help Form readers still get timely guidance as of January 5, 2026.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Why today's quiet news cycle still matters</h3>
    <p>Debt Help Form's monitoring feeds were quiet today, so we distilled internal playbooks into actionable guidance readers can trust right now.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Debt relief scams rise when headlines slow down—verify licensing and Better Business Bureau history before you sign.</li>
      <li>Hardship programs often close quickly; stay prepared with documentation and updated income statements.</li>
      <li>State-specific rules shift each quarter. Revisit your attorney general and CFPB resources so you know the latest disclosures.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Steps to take right now</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>List every unsecured balance with interest rate, servicer, and days past due.</li>
      <li>Contact creditors to request hardship or forbearance options—log every call and keep copies of correspondence.</li>
      <li>Compare consolidation, settlement, and validation paths using certified counselors before you commit.</li>
      <li>Check your credit reports at annualcreditreport.com to confirm accuracy before negotiations start.</li>
      <li>Document any harassment for the CFPB or your state regulator so you can escalate quickly.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Signals that it's time to act</h3>
    <p>Quiet news doesn't mean creditors pause collections. Watch for these triggers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accounts charged off or sold to collections in the past 30 days.</li>
      <li>New lawsuits, wage garnishment notices, or frozen bank accounts.</li>
      <li>Stacked fees or interest rate hikes that make minimum payments unworkable.</li>
      <li>Medical or tax debt layered on top of credit cards, personal loans, or payday balances.</li>
    </ul>
